## Gamified Pathfinding AI
This repository showcases a pathfinding AI system designed for games, using the A* algorithm.

### Features:

Efficient pathfinding with A* algorithm and custom heuristic function.
Adaptable to dynamic game environments.
Handles complex terrain for realistic character movement.
Implemented in Java with clear visualization using Java Swing GUI.
